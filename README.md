Some data have "per capita" value more than 100%, for more information why that
could be possible, please search for "Have more than 100% of older people been
vaccinated?" written 2021 by David Spiegelhalter and Anthony Masters for The
Guardian.

This example is using D3 library

https://d3js.org https://github.com/d3

and some modified example code from https://www.d3indepth.com

All staticial data used in the application is from The Public Health Agency of
Sweden / Folkhälsomyndigheten.

The map ./static/data/lan_7.0.geojson is converted using qgis, layer import,
then export layer as GeoJSON with option RFC7946 enabled. The original file
used was ./resources/tab_svenska_210505.zip owned by Lantmäteriet.
