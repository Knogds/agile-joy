# what do I want to learn or understand better?

Right now, I am very pleased to have discovered node.js and express, a product of Albin's research, as a former student was recommending it as a fastest way to start to develop our project (good communication!). It gives us possibility to quickly test and develop a dynamic website.

Learn and understand better:

- some parts of our work could have been sliced more "vertically", how to deal with it better in the future?
- how to make smaller increases that contribute in project's development, some of the tasks we had this week were a bit too large
- I lack some general knowledge about JS, learn basics
- JS and parsing of JSON, xml
- node.js and express
- Discord helps a lot, but still it feels that there could be a better way to communicate our work on the project (currently on trello.com), find free alternatives to Discord and Trello

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

I think that the key is still in trying to get the team to communicate better. Everyone has a huge personal experience, that is not just factual, knowledge-based. To share the own and enjoy the experience of other team members we have to have some reflection time on why we do the project. Maybe with a simple conversation about the meaning of life. I was traveling recently through Czech Republic and bought a beer for team members x2 so a way to learn something new is also somewhere outside the school. 

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

Everything is still fresh, so getting familiar with the Kanban board we use is still in progress, but I managed to work on and move some tasks from ToDo to Done which felt good! I could have been more active on helping on defining the Epics and Product Backlog, which I will try more in the future.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I contributed on work with visualising the vector map of Swedish Counties on Openstreetmap background, together with legend, via a super easy Leaflet library.
