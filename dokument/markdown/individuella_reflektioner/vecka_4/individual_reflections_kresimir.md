# what do I want to learn or understand better?

Since last time I used JS, for some 20 years ago, people still used Flash for everything more visually demanding. I feel like dinosaur when browsing through all those amazing modern JS libraries - I missed so much so it is great to have the possibility of using some of them for more than just copy-pasting and testing. The one library that could be good for the continuation of our work is D3, because it has all the features we need for the finishing of the project and we wouldn't have to work with 2-3 libraries at the same time and loose time by learning all the basics. The learning curve for D3 is a bit steeper, but it is one of the best libraries for doing data visualisations. Also very important - it is licensed with "equivalent to the BSD 2-Clause and MIT licenses" (https://github.com/d3/d3/blob/main/LICENSE).

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Probably the thing I could help the most is to use my experience (as an artist) to find a way to make a visually pleasing way to present our data. There is still quite a lot of work to be done. We need to find better ways to learn from each other, maybe by using git more often? 

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

I tried to fulfill my delivery on time and was trying to help the future development of the project by giving feedback on how the work on the front-end went, on which parts could be abandoned, as for example using flat-files instead of database for storing the data. 

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I did a map of Sweden + legend with Leaflet but only partly working because I did not have a working GeoJSON map of "Regioner" which is one more division of Sweden that I did not heard of before. Some data is still visualised on the overlapping names of "Regioner" and "Landskap".
