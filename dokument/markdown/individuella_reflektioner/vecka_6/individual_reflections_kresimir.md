# what do I want to learn or understand better?

The more the course is progressing, the more the words "agile" and "scrum"
sound like ideology and less like programming and reading APIs. I would very
much appriciate to talk to a philosopher, a sociologist, a feminist, a guitar
player, a nurse, that has a good common knowledge about all the
computer-API-git-discord-javascript-whatever technicalities that we, students
are too much focused on. I would like to hear more about different
perspectives. It feels like there is a good ground for terrible things to
happen in the future when giving the powerful technology in terms of computer
power and organisational skills, without taking into acount different
perspectives into our work. Is it the weather or lack of serious questions
asked by us in the team that makes our work, this education (CS programme) and
this course more and more meaningless?

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

As I started to learn D3 before the others in the team, I could help by
learning the team the things I thought were the most difficult in the beginning
of the learning process.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

As this week's scrum master, I updated our Backlog with several user stories
that are based upon previous stories, as to try to minimize the steps on our
progres path. Some new stories that bring new features to the project such as,
displaying tables with raw data we use.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I helped some of the group members with my (still very limited) knowledge of D3
library and discussing about the strong points and what could be done to raise
the quality of the code that was produced.
