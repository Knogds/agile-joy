# what do I want to learn or understand better?

Use of scrum in real-life. Test it at home.

# how can I help someone else, or the entire team, to learn something new?

Now the course is over, after weeks of experiencing what might be, scrum, I think of doing something good with it. "IRL". Last week I met a guy with a computer-nerd shirt (something about criptography), a 3-liter wine pack in his hand. He is unimployed he said, very difficult to find a job here, a self-taught programmer. We immediately started to talk about our passion for computers, our first ones, commodore 64s, he had an Atari ST, me an Amiga, yes, we exchanged phone numbers (exchanging phone numbers with complete strangers happens very, very rarely here in Sweden). Quite soon we realized that we had some more common interests, something that could be potentially interesting for other people also, would it be a good idea to do something together, like developing a common project, thinking, planing, designing, programming? We need a scrum board and a bit of discipline. A glass of wine is good to drink with a friend, not so much alone, programming also, perhaps on our common place online? Next time we meet, I will ask him if he could practise some Agile together (I will be very careful because it maybe sounds scary?!).


# what is my contribution towards the team’s use of Scrum?

This week we did not use the scrum board.

# what is my contribution towards the team’s deliveries?

I fixed all the bugs, did some polishing and fine-tuning the project, unfortunately because of I misunderstood when the presentation is going to happen and basically we communicate quite unefficiently, yes some other reasons also, all the job I did was in vane. Nothing and nobody to blame, it was a part of the whole experience, we are all just learning!
